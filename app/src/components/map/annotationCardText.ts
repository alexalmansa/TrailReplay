 * ellipsis. That works for a title someone types into a box while watching it
 * fit, and fails for one taken from a source: "Avituallament 1 — Collet de
 * Barraques" and its list of contents both collapsed to "…", which is how an
 * annotation ends up in exactly the right place and still unreadable.
